# Tags-from-Wikipedia
A bookmarklet to create tags by reformatting Wikipedia article titles to a generic tagging format: removing punctuation and spacing, capitalising intitial letters. Also offers copying to the clipboard. Designed as a possible solution to a specific case but could be applicable elsewhere.
